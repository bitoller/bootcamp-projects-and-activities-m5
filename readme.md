# BOOTCAMP PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES
I'll be posting here all the activities and projects I had to code during my Full Stack bootcamp at Kenzie Academy so I can show my progress from No Stack all the way to a Full Stack Developer. This repository will have almost everything I did during the `fifth module`, or `M5` for short.<br />

The `S` stands for `SPRINT` <strong>e.g.</strong> `S1` means `SPRINT 1`.<br />
The numbers are the activity numbers. Every activity has a name and a number.<br />
The `M` stands for `Modules` <strong>e.g.</strong> `M5` means `Module 5`. That's how the bootcamp curriculum is separated.<br />
→ All the activities and projects have their own readme files with instructions inside their respective folders.

## S1-21-M5 - 07/24/23 - KIOSQUE
For this activity I had to develop a REST API for a fake client who manages a food store, using Python. The purpose of this API is to manage the store, verify if there's a product in the menu, filter food by category, calculate client's tabs and more. The application will include routes for creating, listing, updating and deleting products and tabs.<br />

## S2-20-M5 - 07/31/23 - KOPA DO MUNDO
For this activity I had to develop a REST API for a fake client who manages sport events, using Python and Django. The purpose of this API is to manage the soccer teams. The application will include routes for creating, listing, updating and deleting the teams.<br />
